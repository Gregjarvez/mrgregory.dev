#### Hi, I'm Gregory a self-taught software developer eager to build amazing software with the latest technology stack.

Howdy and welcome 😃. I am a frontend software developer with a decent number of years of software development experience, delivering
functional and responsive web applications and user interface solutions.

Before then I worked and studied as a pharmacy student. Over time, I discovered that building software provided the mental stimulation I needed to survive
as an enthusiatic being and it paid well too 😅. I picked up a book and 6 months after I could confidently call myself a developer. `I have lived happily ever after.`
I have picked up a couple of web technologies, I have favourites of course 😛 but I would pretty much work in any framework or language that suits the task at hand.
For those I am unfamiliar with, Godspeed ⚡️ !.

I contribute to open source projects in my spare time and currently a collaborator to the `react-native-elements` library.
Outside of that, I love fidgeting with game consoles for balance sake 🕹.
